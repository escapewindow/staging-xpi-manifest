# To do

- We likely want to streamline adding a new repository, possibly by adding wildcard or regex support to [ci-configuration](https://hg.mozilla.org/ci/ci-configuration/) and [ci-admin](https://hg.mozilla.org/ci/ci-admin/).

- require a specific revision in release-promotion.py

- add an easy link to the release graph artifacts
