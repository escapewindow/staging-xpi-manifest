# Adding a new xpi

## Creating the repo

During this testing phase, the test template source repo is https://github.com/escapewindow/test-xpi-public . At some point we'll move this to a permanent location and set this up as a github template repo.

The files we need are:

    ```
.cron.yml
.taskcluster.yml
CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
LICENSE
taskcluster/*
    ```
